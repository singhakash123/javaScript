const chai = () => {
    const username = "akash singh chauhan";
    console.log(this.username); // `this` does not have `username` property
    console.log(this); // `this` refers to the enclosing scope
}

// Error Explanation
// this.username:

// In an arrow function, this does not refer to the function itself or the global object. Instead, it refers to the this value of the enclosing lexical context. If you are running this code in a browser's global scope, this would refer to the window object, which does not have a property username.
// As a result, this.username is undefined.
// this:

// The this inside an arrow function is lexically inherited from the enclosing scope. If there is no username property in the enclosing scope's this, this.username will be undefined.
// Correcting the Code
// If you want to access the username variable declared inside the function, you should use the variable directly rather than this.username. Alternatively, if you intended to use a regular function and expect this to refer to the function context, you should use a regular function declaration.

// Using the variable directly 
const chai = () => {
    const username = "akash singh chauhan";
    console.log(username); // Correctly logs the username
    console.log(this); // Still logs the enclosing scope's `this`
}
chai();
// Using a regular function to have this refer to the function context:
function chai() {
    this.username = "akash singh chauhan";
    console.log(this.username); // Logs the username property of `this`
    console.log(this); // Logs the function's `this` context
}
chai();
// However, using a regular function like this will not work correctly if you call chai() in the global scope because this will refer to the global object, and modifying this.username will create a global variable. To correctly handle this within a function, you typically call it as a method of an object.

// Example using a method of an object:
const obj = {
    username: "akash singh chauhan",
    chai: function() {
        console.log(this.username); // Logs the username property of `obj`
        console.log(this); // Logs the `obj` itself
    }
};
obj.chai();
//Conclusion
// To access the username variable inside the chai function correctly, use the variable directly or ensure this is used in the appropriate context.
