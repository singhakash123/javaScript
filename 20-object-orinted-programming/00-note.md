## javascript and classes 

Yes, JavaScript does have classes. While JavaScript is a prototype-based language, ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) introduced the class syntax to provide a clearer and more concise way to create objects and handle inheritance.
While the class syntax is syntactic sugar over JavaScript's existing prototype-based inheritance model, it provides a more traditional and readable way to create and work with objects and their relationships.
